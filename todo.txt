QUESTIONS=======================================================================================

Group
- how do we structure the log file?
- how do we want to split up the work?
- make an example log file to guide our work? can be used as goal for logappend to replicate the example file, can be processed by logread

questions for prof
- do we need to contact other groups on our own or will we have class time to analyze their code?
- do we need to run anything on a server with web components? do we need to use SQL? or is the entire program within the two cpp files and on log file


PROGRAM REQS ===============================================================================

LOGAPPEND REQS - https://course.ece.cmu.edu/~ece732/s24/homework/bibifi/logappend.html

logappend -T <timestamp> -K <token> (-E <employee-name> | -G <guest-name>) (-A | -L) [-R <room-id>] <log>
logappend -B <file>

- input validation - can probably be reused in logread
- process queries
- handle errors
- encryption
- documentation

====================================================================================================================

LOGREAD REQS - https://course.ece.cmu.edu/~ece732/s24/homework/bibifi/logread.html

logread -K <token> -S <log>
logread -K <token> -R (-E <name> | -G <name>) <log>

- input validation
- process queries
- handle errors
- decryption
- documentation

======================================================================================================================

POSSIBLE ERRORS

- inconsistent security tokens when writing to same log file
- logappend query missing essential information
- batch file contains reference to another batch file
- extra arguments in queries
- batch file contains unusable query
-
